# ArrayList-Practice
Build your own `ArrayList` and test it's functionality in the `Driver` class.  You must provide an implementation for all of the standard functionalities of an `ArrayList` including *adding*, *setting*, *removing*, and *deleting*.

### Tips:
Do some reasearch on the inner workings of the ArrayList in Java 8.  Resources like [this](https://www.netjstech.com/2015/08/how-arraylist-works-internally-in-java.html#:~:text=ArrayList%20in%20Java%20is%20a,class%20to%20store%20its%20elements.&text=When%20elements%20are%20removed%20from%20an%20ArrayList%20space%20created%20by,filled%20in%20the%20underlying%20array.) may be helpful.
