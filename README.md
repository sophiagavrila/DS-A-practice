# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice
> ðŸ•™ **Due**: ***10:00am Monday May 24th*** I may ask you to walk me through your implementation in our one-on-one interview.

<br>

This challenge repository contains 2 separate challenges:

- **Sorting Challenge**: Create a custom merge sort and bubble sort.
- **ArrayList Challenge**:  Create a custom ArrayList with associated insert, update, retrieve, and delete functionality.

## Project Importing instructions
There are two separate repositories within this challange repository.

<br>

I reccomend that when you `Open Projects From File System`, you import each one, both `sorting-practice` and `arraylist-practice`, rather than the entire `DS-A-practice` folder.
